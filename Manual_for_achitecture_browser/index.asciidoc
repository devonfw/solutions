== Manual for architecture browser

These content help you to know how you can contribute to the content of the architecture browser.

=== Create Github user

Without a GitHub account you can't contribute on the architecture browser.

It is very simple to create an account on GitHub. 
First, you have to go to GitHub.com and you'll be greeted by the welcome page then click on "sign up", now enter your email address your password and your username. You can choose if you want or not to receive the newsletter of GitHub after to verify your account you can click on "create account" .

You will receive automatically a verification email open that and click on the link,your GitHub account is now available.

=== Fetch upstream or fork repository

If the repository already exists in your account, it will eventually become out of date, you have to make the changes that were made on the main repository. To do that, you have to click on "Fetch upstream " and choose "Fetch and merge".

But if it doesn't exist, then you have to fork it, so that the main repository will be generated in your own account. To do that, please click on the icon "Fork" from the main repository.

=== Open the repository on Gitpod

"The repository is already on your account." -> "Please go to your fork (https://github.com/<username>/architectures) and open the repository in the online IDE Gitpod." 

You have only to go in the Readme.md and click on "https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/ ". This unique URL will automatically detect which repository it was visited from, and open that in Gitpod (using the Referrer HTTP header).

=== Create or Change solution

You have the possibility to create a new solution. Each solution is located in its own directory and consists of an asciidoc file, in which the solution is specified. 
So create a new folder in inside the solutions directory and the file for the soltution. The file is always named 'index.asciidoc'.

Go to https://github.com/devonfw/architectures/blob/master/solution-template.asciidoc to see a template for creating architecture solutions, copy this file and delete this explanation and adapt.
Please don't use first-level headlines because they are converted to the page title and not to a headline.

To change a solution, select the file of this solution, change the content and save.

==== Upload file

To upload a file, you have to click on the menu button on the far left.

Select "File", then choose "open File". Enter the name of your file and click "ok". The selected file will be directly opened in the editor.

=== Commit and Push

You should do each solution on a new branch and not take the master branch because that can lead to conflicts.

To create your own branch, select the icon "source control".

Go on the icon "view and more action". 

image::./addManual_image/menu.png[menu button] 

Choose "branch" and select "create branch". Give the name of the branch and press "Enter".

Now you can already do a commit, for this you must first make sure that a change has been made. Select the icon "source control", go on the icon "view and more action" choose "commit", provide the commit message and press "Enter" to confirm.

You can push, by clicking again on the icon "source control", go on the icon "view and more action" choose "push".

=== Create a pull request

After doing a push, go to your Git account and create a pull request by clicking on "compare & pull request".

image::./addManual_image/pr.png[PR]
That is important to accept CLA if not yet done. For this you will see that on your repository 

image::./addManual_image/cla.png[cla]
only you have to do is to click on "Contributor License Agreement". It will send you on the CLA page, now you can agree the CLA.

It can happen CLA does not work with the firefox browser, in this case simply change your browser.

NOTE: Gitpod is the way to edit online. But to modify locally using on your own editor, read https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#first-contributions[first contribution]


=== Stack specific solution

In devonfw we have the principle that we store the documentation together with the code. This also means that architecture snippets that refer to a specific technology stack such as Java or .net are in the repo of this devonfw stack. To do this, create a “solutions” folder in the “documentation” subfolder of the repository. This then has the same structure internally as the “solutions” folder in the architectures repo. When the website is compiled, the folders of the stack repository are integrated into the folder in the architecture repository.
