=== Options for running Apache Kafka on Microsoft Azure
image::options.png[Kafka options]

[#EventHub]
==== Event Hub
Azure Event Hubfootnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-for-kafka-ecosystem-overview] supports Apache Kafka producer and consumer APIs

[green]#+ Simplest option# +
[red]#- No compression# +
[red]#- No Kafka streams#

[#AKS]
==== AKS
Kafka on Kubernetes (AKS) using Operatorsfootnote:[e.g. https://strimzi.io/ or Confluent Operator]

* rack awareness to spread brokers across availability zones
* Kubernetes taints and tolerations to run Kafka on dedicated nodes
* expose Kafka outside Kubernetes using NodePort
* Load balancer and Ingress, depending on your needs
* easily secured using TLS


[green]#+ Full control# +
[green]#+ dedicated cluster# +
[red]#- Most complex option# +
[red]#- potentially higher compute and storage cost#


[#ConfluentCloud]
==== Confluent Cloud
Confluent Cloudfootnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/apache-kafka-confluent-cloud/overview] is now integrated in Azure Marketplace

image::confluent-resource.png["Confluent Resource", width=400, link=images/confluent-resource.png]

* https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/get-started/index.html[QuickStart]
* You need to sign up for an account with Confluent in addition to the Azure account
* Observability via 
** Confluent Control Centerfootnote:[https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/index.html#control-center]
*** monitor system health in predefined dashboards and to alert on triggers
*** reports end-to-end stream monitoring
*** measures how long messages take
*** determines the source of any issues in your cluster
** Confluent Metric API, and e.g. Prometheus and Grafana

+


[green]#+ Reliable managed service# +
[green]#+ Confluent ecosystem: Kafka Connect, KSQL, Connectors (source & sink both), Confluent Schema Registry, Replicator# +
[red]#- No dedicated cluster (just multi-tenant cluster)# +
[red]#- No BYOK for data encryption#

[#HDInsight]
==== HDInsight
Azure HDInsightfootnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction] is a fully-managed cloud distribution of Hadoop Components. It supports many open-source frameworks like Apache Spark, Hive, Apache Storm, R Server, Apache HBase and of course Apache Kafka. It provides 99.99% SLA on Kafka uptime & uses Azure Managed Disks as the backing store for Kafka brokers (providing up to 16TB of storage per broker).

* Security:
** VNet Integration (cluster can be totally isolated)
** Integration with Azure AD, no Kafka ACLs, though
** Domain Joined VMs (services on VMs run seamlessly for authenticated users)
** BYOK & Managed Identity
* Monitoring:
** Integration with Azure Monitoring


[green]#+ Fully managed# +
[green]#+ Dedicated cluster# +
[red]#- No autoscale# +
[red]#- Dedicated cluster also means higher cost for compute and storage#

=== Comparison
There is no “one size fits all” solution, of course. +
Agraj Mangal from Microsoft provides a nice comparison (see table below).

If you need a *dedicated cluster*, you should go with [green]#*AKS*# or [green]#*HDInsight*#.

For *BYOK*-requirements, go with anything but [red]#*Confluent Cloud*#.

But, if you want the most *Kafka features* with the least amount of customer-management necessity, go with [green]#*Confluent Cloud*#.

For *simple Kafka-API-Integration* without any management necessity, go with [green]#*Event Hub*#.

Kafka on [red]#*VM*# is only recommended as a first step, to try out Kafka.
